    <p>
      Since 2008 and 2015 respectively, the NTHU International Volunteer Team has been promoting information and communications technology(ICT) education programs in Tanzania and Kenya. Over the past decade, they have delivered more than 1,800 refurbished computers and established over 100 computer classrooms, benefiting around 100,000 children. In 2023, the Kenya team became the first to return on-site after the pandemic. The Tanzania team, originally scheduled to resume in 2024, was merged into the Kenya program due to a red travel alert. The team expanded its services through two separate routes, A and B. Meanwhile, the Tanzania project continues remotely and is expected to resume in-person operations in 2025. In April 2024, through a referral from ASUS, the team also conducted a preliminary assessment of ICT education needs in Eswatini, sending a scouting team after the Kenya project concluded to evaluate feasibility.

    <p>
      ICT education requires long-term dedication, and in the post-pandemic era, the key lies in 'resilience.' In 2024, despite the red travel alert in Tanzania and anti-tax protests in Kenya, we not only upheld our commitments and successfully carried out our plans, but also proactively expanded to Eswatini, one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, bringing help to more children. In 2025, our team is set to embark once again—not only to Kenya, Tanzania, and Eswatini, but also with an advance team heading to Mozambique. We hope that in the future, we can help bridge the digital divide and ensure that children across Africa have access to the education they deserve.
